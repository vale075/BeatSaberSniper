# BeatSaberSniper

Creates a playlist based on someone's scoresaber recent or top played songs.
You can choose the number of songs you want in the playlist and the songs will bee ordered accordingly.

## Playlist path
The first time you use the script it will ask you for a path that is then stored in `Playlist path.txt`. You can put any valid path, but it is recommended to use the Beat Saber playlist folder :

### Steam
The default path is
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\Playlists\`

If you have your games installed on a different drive, it might be
`F:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\Playlists\`

### Oculus
`C:\Program Files\Oculus\Software\Software\hyperbolic-magnetism-beat-saber\Playlists\`
